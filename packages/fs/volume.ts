/**
 * Path-based filesystem interface built on top of FileSystem.
 *
 * Design principles:
 * - All paths are absolute (start with '/').
 * - No encoding at this layer — I/O is always Uint8Array. The caller decodes.
 * - No hidden cursor state — readdir returns the full list, scan streams via
 *   a visitor.
 * - Symlinks are followed by default (stat, readFile, etc). Use lstat to
 *   inspect a symlink itself.
 * - Errors follow POSIX naming (ENOENT, EEXIST, ENOTDIR, EISDIR, ENOTEMPTY)
 *   thrown as plain Error objects with the code at the start of the message.
